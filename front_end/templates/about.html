<h2>About CodeBuddy</h2>

<p>CodeBuddy was created by the <a href="https://piccolo.byu.edu" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Piccolo lab</a>. Our goal is to enable people around the world to more effectively learn how to write code and analyze data. With this Web-based tool, instructors create programming and data-analysis exercises that are organized into courses, assignments, and exercises. For each exercise, learners are presented with a description of the exercise, as well as the expected output. The learners must then write code to match the expected output. These outputs can be either text-based or graphics-based.</p>
